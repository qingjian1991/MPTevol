## The Main analysis
In this fold, the main analysis are including: 

(1) Estimating the CCF values based on CHAT

(2) The comparison between different regions.

(3) The phylogenetic tress of samples and the mutations clsuters across samples.

(4) The clonal orders and the clonal evolution history.


### 1. Estimating the CCF values based on CHAT
**scripts**: CCF_adjust.R

### 2. The comparison between different regions.
**scripts**: meskit_analysis.R

MesKit_plot.Rmd provides the visualizations, see online: https://rpubs.com/cqj_00/MesKit_plot 


### 3. The phylogenetic tress of samples and the mutations clusters across samples.
**scripts**: CCF_plot.R

plot_trees.Rmd is intent to build samples trees from mutations, See online: https://rpubs.com/cqj_00/plot_trees

### 4. The clonal orders and the clonal evolution history.
**scripts**: CCF_clonevol.R
